		“Good Behavior,” a noirish new series beginning on Tuesday on TNT, about a sultry con artist, has a built-in pitch. See Lady Mary clean a toilet! See her make a crack pipe out of a light bulb! Devout fans of “Downton Abbey” will want to check it out just for the freak-show appeal.

		Michelle Dockery, who played the highborn Mary Crawley in “Downton,” actually brings some of the same qualities to the lowlife Letty Dobesh in “Good Behavior,” and they serve the character well. The guarded eyes, the hard stare, the general sense of sarcasm waiting to happen — if Mary had been reincarnated as a parolee in present-day North Carolina, she’d look and act like this.

		As the show opens, Letty is flipping burgers after being released from prison early for, yes, good behavior. She has a long rap sheet, various addictions and a restraining order that keeps her from seeing her young son. Unfairly fired from the diner, she turns to what she knows, robbing hotel rooms in league with a crooked desk clerk.
