		<p>As a new Web Developer, I would like to tell a story with my page.</p>
		<p> As a first step to becoming a Web Developer, I would like to take stock of my skills and goals.</p>
		<p> After having spent 10 years as a backend programmer, I feel it's time to break out and reinvent myself as a Web Devloper. I would like to get a job as a professional Web Developer and make Web sites for my friends and their businesses.</p>
<p>I'm most interested in JQuery and using Web sites to display analytical data. An example might be to display the census data for 2010 and compare it to the census data from 2020.</p>
<p>My programming skills should be very useful for creating websites. I'm an expert in many programming languages including JAVA, Python, perl, c++ and Unix shell scripts, such as bash.</p>
<p> the skills that I need to bruch on involve Graphic Arts. As a Data Scientist, I've rarely focused on the visual design of websites. I also need to up my creative skills in photography and video production.</p>
<p>The hardware and software that I use is the Apple Mac Book Pro. I'm typically used Microsoft for business so I have the challage of migrating to the Mac for my daily software development projects.</p>
<p>I will likely need to purchase Photoshop and illustrator to process my photography and prepare the photos for Web pages.</p>
