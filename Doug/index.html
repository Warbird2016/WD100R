		<p><strong>As a first step to becoming a Web Developer, I would like to take stock of my skills and goals.</strong></p>
                   </li>
                   <li>
		<p> After having spent 10 years as a backend programmer, I feel it's time to break out and reinvent myself as a <i>Web Developer</i>. I would like to get a job as a <strong><mark> Web Developer</mark></strong> and make Web sites for my friends and their businesses.</p>
                   </li>
                   <li>
<p>I'm most interested in JQuery and using Web sites to <u>display analytical data</u>. An example might be to display the census data for 2010 and compare it to the census data from 2020.</p>
                   </li>
                   <li>
<p>My programming skills should be very useful for creating websites. I'm an expert in many programming languages including <strong>JAVA</strong>, Python, perl, c++ and Unix shell scripts, such as bash.</p>
                   </li>
                   <li>
<p>The skills that I need to brunch into involve <i>Graphic Arts</i>. As a Data Scientist, I've rarely focused on the visual design of websites. I also need to up my creative skills in photography and video production.</p>
                   </li>
                   <li>
<p>The hardware and software that I use is the Apple Mac Book Pro. I'm typically used Microsoft for business so I have the challage of migrating to the Mac for my daily software development projects.</p>
                   </li>
                   <li>
<p>I will likely need to purchase Photoshop and illustrator to process my photography and prepare the photos for Web pages.</p>
                   </li>
